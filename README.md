##  Overview

EmpowerHer bridges the gap between safety and accessibility by using technology and gamification to make self-defence training engaging and effective.
Most existing self-defence systems are offline, rigid, and non-interactive. EmpowerHer provides an online, affordable, and game-based learning platform that helps women learn preventive and defensive techniques through structured video lessons, challenges, and assessments.
